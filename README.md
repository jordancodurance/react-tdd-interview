# React Pairing Exercise

## Introduction

This exercise should be completed as if you are pairing on a feature within a real business setting.

Don't be afraid to ask questions, and do communicate your thinking.

## Goal

Test-drive a component that can take in data, and render it as a table.

Use `./design.png` as a reference. You don't need to worry about styling to begin with.

`./src/data/userData.ts` contains example data that should be rendered.
